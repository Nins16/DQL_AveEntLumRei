Initialized the dqn script.

Key Notes:
Main algo used is Neighborhood DQL where the current action of 
neighboring states are included in the agent.
The agent holds the model.

Note:
- Demand not yet included
- It is important to install the following libs:
	-(matplotlib, pandas, numpy, torch, tqdm)
- Sumo must also be installed

Problems:
(1) I don't know how to add the agents as a data type. Should I use lists or dict?
(2) I don't know how i should implement the model within the agent
(3) Hyperparameters of all models should be universal

Solutions:
(1) Better to use a dict /
(2) We'll let the environment initialize the NN /
(3) Use json to hold the hyperparameter values

Added neighbor script in get_state
Added randomized state
Added init_tls_properties
Added init_neural_net
Added Error Check in get_e2_detectors
tls_dict['phases'] changed from state to state index
removed get_neighbor function(since it is already added to the get_state function)
Added update_current_action
Added cycle length init variable in environment
Updated Network

Todo:
get_state function:
	- change joint action variable to phase length in percentage relative to cycle length /
	- Replace OHV to the percentage of phase length relative to cycle length in traffic light /

add script in update_current_action /
add get_e2_detectors(Maybe e3? check with members)
