Initialized the dqn script.

Key Notes:
Main algo used is Neighborhood DQL where the current action of 
neighboring states are included in the agent.
The agent holds the model.

Note:
- Demand not yet included
- It is important to install the following libs:
	-(matplotlib, pandas, numpy, torch, tqdm)
- Sumo must also be installed

Problems:
(1) I don't know how to add the agents as a data type. Should I use lists or dict?
(2) I don't know how i should implement the model within the agent
(3) Hyperparameters of all models should be universal

Solutions:
(1) Better to use a dict
(2) We'll let the environment initialize the NN
(3) Use json to hold the hyperparameter values
